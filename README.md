Lexis - An inspired dictionary by RedRoma


# Intro

We tried finding a good Latin Dictionary.  
They all sucked.  
Rome deserves better.  
RedRoma decided to do something about it.  
Project Lexis was born.

# Motivation

At RedRoma, we constantly reference Latin vocabulary. However, we not only want to know what a word's definition is, but we also want to know:  
+ The Top 10 Google results  of the word
+ Any images associated with the word  
+ If the word is being used by a company  
+ If the word is used in popular culture (Movies, Music, etc)  

# Design

Classic with a modern feel.  
Useful, but not verbose.  
Embellished, but not overdone.
