## The Lexicon of Rome


# Intro

I was working on another project, and we were at the point where we needed to pick a name.   
Of course, we had to look through the latin dictionary.  
I went to the App Store to download a legit Latin Dictionary app.  
They all sucked.

Rome deserves better.

# Motivation

I'll be honest here. I just feel like creating dope shit. There is no business justification, or perhaps there is no real problem, except that I have a creative itch, and I need to scratch it.


# Design

Classic with a modern feel.  
Useful, but not verbose.  
Embellished, but not overdone.


# Features

We not only want to know what a word's definition is, but we also want to know: 

+ Word of the day. Something to keep it fresh.
+ The Top 10 Google results of the word. See how the word is being used today.
+ Any images associated with the word.   
+ If the word is being used by a company. You probably wouldn't want to use it for a Business Name.
+ If the word is used in popular culture (Movies, Music, etc)
